#Tic-Tac-Toe

##Technologies used
The game was built using the following
- **HTML**
- **CSS and BootStrap.com**
- **Javascript**
- **jQuery**



##Approach
I stored the whole game inside of one object. Inside of that object I have multiple properties, some of which are functions. From inside of these functions I am able to reference and manipulate other properties values.
I also tried to keep the property in the object at the view of that object on the browser seperate to keep my code more clean and readable.
